# Summary of hours

# First Semester

## Josh Lenhart
### 6 Hours (Documentation)
- I did most of the documentation assignments so this took up a decent amount of time.

### 15 hours (Scraper Development)
- I  began the early stages of creating the web scraping script during the first semester. This did not require much planning or research as I had experience in doing this before. I was able to get the basic layout finished as well as starting to scrape the first few parts.

## Josh Timmers
### 12 hours (Web Development)
- Josh began researching the framework we would use for the website. We discovered that NextJS seemed like a good fit for our project. Josh began doing tutorials for NextJS to learn it and then got the basic layout of our website started.

# Second Semester

## Josh Lenhart
### 8 hours (Documentation)
### 32 hours (Scraper Development)
- As the web scraper got more fleshed out, the run time started increasing a lot. Along with this, I started getting random errors due to similar pages being layed out differently. This meant that there was a lot of debugging which was made worse due to the long run times.

## Josh Timmers
### 20 hours ( Web Development)
- Josh got the layout of the pages working, however, he started facing some issues with the javascript. This was mainly due to neither of us having any experience with web development.

## Josh Lenhart & Josh Timmers
### 15 hours (meetings)
### 15 hours (Joint Web Development)
- We decided to work together to try and get more of the web development finished. We were able to push through some of the issues, however, there were still some things we weren't able to get working.
