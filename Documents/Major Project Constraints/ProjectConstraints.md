Major Project Constraints

Our first major constraint is time. According to the timeline that we created, our project could potentially be completed (at the base level) by the 1st of March, which gives us quite a good amount of breathing room in terms of deadlines. However, projects rarely go 100% according to plan, and one of our milestones could take a significant amount more time than initially expected. This is especially true for us as we have never built a website from nothing before, so learning aspects of this process may prove to be troublesome. 

Our second major constraint is technical specifics. As mentioned previously, we do not have experience in building a brand new website from the ground up. This lack of specific experience could lead to certain aspects of the project being quite difficult to complete, especially if we want to complete the project in time. However, Josh Lenhart does have experience from his co-op position in web scraping with Python, an important aspect of our website, so this constraint is not a total block. 

Our third major constraint is the environment in which we are building the website. As of right now, we plan to have the server only running locally on our personal machines. This could prove to be an issue if we need or want to expand it to public use. Our current plan is just to keep it on our local machines until we complete the website, and if we finish with enough extra time left, look into potential ways that we could open our website to the public.
