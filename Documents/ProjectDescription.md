## Project Description
It is estimated that nearly half of the world enjoys gaming. PC gaming makes up a large portion of this. There is an incredible amount of technology that goes into this. To be at the forefront of this, having the newest PC parts is a great start. This isn't always feasible for people as the parts can be quite expensive. In order to aid in this our team plans to create a website to show the best deals and their associated performance. This will help any user get the best bang for the buck as well as knowing how well the parts will perform.

While there are solutions out there like pcpartpicker.com, this is not a complete package. The goal is not to just have the best prices or benchmarks. The goal is to have a full suite with everything needed for people who may not know a lot about building PCs. This is where most current tools fall behind. This tool will have biggest discounts, potentially better bang for the buck items, resources for building the PC once the parts arive, and much more.

There will be many different technologies used in this tool. The website itself will use HTML, CSS, and React. This will aid in making the website very interactable as well as intuitive. The back end will use Python and most likely a MySQL database. The Python will be used to scrape multiple different sites for data to be used in the website. The MySQL database will be used to store all of the data that is scraped. This will then all come together to create a user friendly experience.

In order to accomplish this, many technologies will be combined. There will be a homepage with some of the biggest deals along with the different pages for other parts of the site. This would include a search bar for searching for parts, guides for building the PC, performance charts, and much more. In order to get this data, many sites would be scraped for prices and benchmarks. A job would be ran on a consistent basis such as every hour or daily in order to get the data.
