# Milestones
  1. Successfully get the initial webpage working.
     - Neither of us have much experience in making a website from scratch. As such, getting the initial website up and running with a basic page will be a big success for us.
     - Expected completion: 11/12/2021
  2. Successfully implement a database.
     - As there will be tons of data required to implement all of the features we would like to have, having a good database is a must. This will need to store all of the data farmed from the respective websites.
     - Expected completion: 11/27/2021
  3. Successfully refine the page for parts listing.
     - Having the data for all of the parts displayed is one of our biggest milestones. This will show all of the available models for the type of part the user selected.
     - Expected completion: 01/15/2022
  4. Successfully design the page to display the specific model selected.
     - This page will display to the user the price, performance, and specs of the specific model that the user selected. The page will include different stores from which to purchase the part, benchmarks, the technical specs of the part, and whether it meets the recommended or minimum requirements of popular games.
     - Expected completion: 01/22/2022
  5. Successfully design page for the build guide.
     - Having a guide for building the pc after the parts have been purchased will make the guide a one-stop shop for everything needed to build a PC that meets a users requirements.
     - Expected completion: 02/05/2022
  6. Successfully refine website with all features.
     - Once we have completed all previous milestones, there are specific smaller features like suggesting other models with similar performance at a lower price. We would also like to spend time refining the website so that it is visually pleasing and easy to use.
     - Expected completion: 03/01/2022
